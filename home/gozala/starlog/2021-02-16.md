# February 16th



- Did bunch of changes to [symbiotic network][] pitch.
- Had team call where I got feedback on current state of [symbiotic network][] pitch
  - Name "symbiotic network" leaves a wrong impression
  - Need a list of capabilities host nodes will share with symbiont to give better idea of the scope
  - Feature comparison table to better illustrate gaps, with columns for
    1. embedded ipfs
    2. ipfs client
    3. symbiont
- Got feedback from @momack2
  - Think about this related to remote IPFS nodes
  - üëç "0 cost to switch backing node"
- Collaborated  with @hugomrdias to get  a proposal for 
  - Add bunch of new examples to illustrate different use cases so it is not leaving impression of just browser nodes leveraging IPFS Desktop.
  - In an attempt to clarify `symbiont <> host` protocol, I recognized similarity to [DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD)][] and decided to reframe everything through those lens.
  - End up renaming proposal to "symbiosis protocol"
- Discussions with @hugomrdias on how current signaling infrastructure leads to network fragmentation, led us towards [Distributed signaling][] subject. We have decided to start a new project proposal for it.
- Me and @hugomrdias have decided to submit IPNS project pitch as is & work on improving it inside a PR.



- ‚ö°Ô∏èSubmitted [Symbiosis protocol][]  pitch.
- ‚ö°Ô∏èSubmitted [Reliable Mutability Primitive][]  pitch.
