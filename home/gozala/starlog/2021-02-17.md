# February 17th



- Incorporated suggested changes into proposed project pitches.

- Joined a team call to get in sync on proposed ranking of current proposals.

- Had a call with @vmx to discuss a strategy of updating js-ipfs to new [@multiformats][]

  - Agreed that best path forward would be to swap out CID implementation first.
  - I proposed we drop `ipfs.dag` API in favor of `ipfs.block` (requires feedback from @achingbrain)
    - We could/should realize separate library that can provide current `ipfs.dag` compatible API so users can choose their phase of migration or just use that other library.
    - Maybe `ipfs.block` API needs to be amended to allow getting block with a path in order to avoid unnecessary roundtrips (something that `ipfs.dag` does today).

- Migrated @carsonfarmer's feedback on [Reliable Mutability Primitive][] proposal into PR.

- Had a call with @carsonfarmer who wanted to provide feedback on [Symbiosis protocol][] as he had been exploring related ideas (my notes nested below)

  - IPFS provides a good distributed storage, but it lacks p2p services (that could be incentivized with token and/or conventional forms of payements)
  - Has a prototype of [RPC over libp2p][libp2p-rpc] (Built on top of @mikeal's [znode][]).
  - In P2P host providing service does not really matter as long as result has CID.
    - Same host (in symbiosis protocol terms) could be represented by multiple peers (e.g. textile has bunch of thread nodes but it does not matter which one you talk to)
  - [Fission UCAN][] are worth looking into
    - Nested JWTs representing capability proofs
    - E.g. You can sign a pinning request, and delegate capability to execute it to a different actor with a specified timeframe.
    - üí≠ Should learn more about. Maybe that is a more formal way to represent service permission as opposed to reusing `peerid` that  "symbiont protocol" suggested.

- Followed the suggestion and submitting incomplete proposals

  - [Distributed signaling][]
    [Infrastructure coop][]
    [Unified FileSystem API][]

- Conversation with @carsonfarmer got me thinking how would hosts describe a services they provide in [symbiosis protocol][]

  - [node][] does not has a schema language and is way too nodejs specific.
  - I am impartial towards [GraphQL][]
    - It is has well type interface (as in it has a type system)
    - Has batching builtin (reducing roundtrips)
    - Is able to compose mutation & querying

- üí°It would make most immediate sense to represent [AST][] of the [GraphQL schema][] as a DAG and use that in service announcements.

- üí°Could we use [IPLD schemas][] as more IPLD native way to represent service specification ?

  - [Engaged IPLD team with above question](https://protocollabs.slack.com/archives/CGVA4K02Y/p1613603914427900)
  - @willscott pointed out [go-ipld-graphql][] that bridges IPLD data to GraphQL
    - Although it appears to be just for querying & not mutation
    - You'd still have to generate GraphQL schema from it and add your mutations
    - That seems to suggest that would not be anything other than service implementation detail as host would still have to describe interface with GraphQL schema.
  - @willscott suggested that idiomatic IPLD mutations would take a form of submitting diffs encoded as IPLD
    - That assumes all of the state is mutable which is not the case in practice.
  - Got me wondering if you could describe service as `{state: State inbox: Message}` struct in [IPLD Schema][]. 
    - You could query state (just like you do in GraphQL)
    - And send messages to inbox (to cause effects)
    - In fact GraphQL Schema is `{ query: Query, mutation: Mutation }` 
  - ‚ö°Ô∏èWe could actually express service is IPLD Schema `{ query: Query, mutation: Mutation }`
    - However IPLD Schemas have no notion similar to [GraphQL Arguments][]
    - It would be of little use without [IPLD Selectors][]
      - Reading through selectors spec I am under impression that it does not retain a structure.
      - We might be able to define custom "Service Selector" IPLD Schema
      - It can be a lot simpler that [IPLD Selectors][]
        - Just field and element matching

- Investigating [ipfs-webui progress UI][] PR to figure out why is it failing in CI
