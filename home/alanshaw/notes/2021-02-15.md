# Notes 2021-02-15

Add proposal for the project stages identified in `OPERATIONS.md`, and what happens at each of them.

Here we can add when we:

* Involve stakeholders and how often to check in.
* Pre-pitch to team feedback/evaluation + invite stakeholders!

How sign off works.

It should talk about being good at **exporting tech** and best practices to ensure what we build it adopted well. This will avoid us becoming maintainers of everything.

Have community transition plan:
    * Define repo interaction rules (standard contrubution guidelines + branch restrictions and minimum reviewers etc.). Be [open open source](https://openopensource.org/).

Define minimum broadcast of new tech. It's a recorded demo, it's a shipped email, it's a speak at a conference? etc. etc.
